===========
3DOG: v0.1
===========
This is a small two week project I made in Uni based on the prompt, 'Looking & Seeing'. Might follow up with this idea because I like the concept created using the 3D glasses.


SUMMARY:
You are a dog tasked with defeating slime and equipped only with 3D glasses... and laser eye vision. To slay the slimes you must shoot the slimes with the correct coloured laser by closing either your left or right eye. As of right now it's just and endless shooting game to get points, 10pts for dodging slimes as they pass or 100pts for defeating them.

HOW TO PLAY:
Using your MOUSE you are able to move your character left and right while the LEFT CLICK will allow you to shoot but only if you have an eye closed. To only see blue, hold down A to close your left eye and to only see red, hold down D to close your right eye.

MOUSE controls sideways movement
LEFT CLICK to shoot (must press multiple times, no holding down)
A closes the left eye (turns it to blue)
D closes the right eye (turns it to red)

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Create a storyline to follow
- Different maps/areas
- Difficulty changes
- Powerups/New features
- UI and other 'salad dressings'
